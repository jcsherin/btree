# B+Tree

This is a thread-safe implementation of the B+Tree index data structure.

- It implements the Bayer-Schkolnick concurrency protocol described
  in [Concurrency of Operations on B-Trees](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~david/courses/cs758/Fall2007/papers/Concurrency%20of%20Operations.pdf).
- The algorithm for insertion and deletion is from the
  textbook [Database System Concepts - 7th edition](https://db-book.com/).
- This code is adapted from the B+Tree implementation in the now
  archived [NoisePage DBMS](https://db.cs.cmu.edu/projects/noisepage/),
  which can be
  found [here](https://github.com/cmu-db/noisepage/blob/master/src/include/storage/index/bplustree.h).

## Draft
# B+Tree
## Internals
A B+Tree is an (index) balanced tree data structure with many variants
and of widespread use in transactional database systems.
### Key Features
It supports efficient:

- point queries (key has to be an exact match)
- range queries (keys within a range which satisfies a predicate)
- forward and reverse sequential scans (in sorted key order)

### Data Structure Invariants
The B+Tree is a balanced tree data structure. It means that the distance
from the root node to the leaf node is the same regardless of which path
is traversed. The key-value data pairs are stored only at the leaf node
level. A new key-value pair is always inserted in sorted order in a leaf
node. The internal nodes exist to guide key based search and traversing
to the right leaf node where a key maybe found. The leaf nodes are also
connected to their siblings like a doubly linked list which makes range
queries, and sequential scans possible.

### Planner Access Method
The database optimiser can generate a query plan which avoids an
explicit sort step for queries which specify a sort order on a column
attribute if there is a B+Tree index defined on that column. This is
possible because the keys are already in sorted order, and possible to
scan the leaf nodes sequentially in both forward and reverse directions.

### Stable Worst Case Performance
The balanced natured of the B+Tree also guarantees stable performance
for key lookups regardless of the total number of keys. The lookup time
depends only on the total number of keys stored in the B+Tree and the
node degree. Node degree is the total child nodes a node can have. It
also alternatively known as branching factor or fanout. For example, a
B+Tree with a billion key-values and node degree of 64 has to search no
more than 5 nodes in the entire tree to find a match.

### Memory and I/O
Nearly 99% of the nodes in a B+Tree are leaf nodes and only 1% of the
nodes are internal nodes. So even when the B+Tree stores a large number
of key-values and they do not fit into memory it maybe possible to fit
the B+Tree into memory all the internal nodes. The leaf node being
searched is then just one disk I/O away. Hot leaf nodes can be cached
using a limited amount of additional memory, and a cache eviction policy
which is resistant to sequential flooding, further reducing disk I/O for
search queries.

### Key Lookups
The implementation of search is straight forward. Start at the root node
of the tree and find the pivot <key, node pointer> pair for the input
search key. Follow the node pointer down to the child node, and repeat
until traversal reaches the leaf node. Return the value attached to the
key if there is an exact match, or nothing.

### Rebalance After Inserts
When inserting a new <key, value> pair the same method as above is
followed to navigate to the leaf node into which the insertion will
happen. If the leaf node is not full we insert the <key, value> in-place
in sorted order. If the leaf node is full then it has to be split and
the existing <key, value> elements distributed evenly between both the
nodes. After the node split the <key, value> pair the node into which it
is inserted depends on the distribution of existing keys. Now a <key,
node pointer> pair has to be added to the parent internal node to attach
the newly created node to the tree. If the internal node is full, the
split operation has to be repeated. And itâ€™s possible the split can
propagate back up to the root of the tree. If the root itself needs to
split, then a new root node is created and the old root is made a child
of the new root node. This increases the height of the B+Tree. This is
how we rebalance the tree if an insert causes the nodes to overflow.
